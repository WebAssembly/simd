# SIMD proposal for WebAssembly

This repository holds a proposal for adding 128-bit SIMD support to
WebAssembly. It is a copy of the
[WebAssembly/spec](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec) repository with the
addition of a [proposals/simd](proposals/simd) directory.

The proposal describes how 128-bit packed SIMD types and operations can be
added to WebAssembly. It is based on [previous work on SIMD.js in the Ecma TC39
ECMAScript committee](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_simd) and the
[portable SIMD specification](https://github.com/stoklund/portable-simd) that
resulted.

The [proposed specification](proposals/simd/SIMD.md) has the details.

# SIMD support for WebAssembly

This proposal describes how 128-bit packed SIMD types and operations can be
added to WebAssembly. It is based on [previous work on SIMD.js in the Ecma TC39
ECMAScript committee](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_simd) and the
[portable SIMD specification](https://github.com/stoklund/portable-simd) that
resulted.

The [proposed specification](SIMD.md) has the details.
